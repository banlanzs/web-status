POST getMonitors
This is a Swiss-Army knife type of a method for getting any information on monitors.

By default, it lists all the monitors in a user's account, their friendly names, types (http, keyword, port, etc.), statuses (up, down, etc.) and uptime ratios.

There are optional parameters which lets the getMonitors method to output information on any given monitors rather than all of them.

And also, parameters exist for getting the notification logs (alerts) for each monitor and even which alert contacts were alerted on each notification.

Parameters
Parameter	Description
api_key	required
monitors	optional (if not used, will return all monitors in an account. Else, it is possible to define any number of monitors with their IDs like: monitors=15830-32696-83920)
types	optional (if not used, will return all monitors types (HTTP, keyword, ping..) in an account. Else, it is possible to define any number of monitor types like: types=1-3-4)
statuses	optional (if not used, will return all monitors statuses (up, down, paused) in an account. Else, it is possible to define any number of monitor statuses like: statuses=2-9)
custom_uptime_ratios	optional (defines the number of days to calculate the uptime ratio(s) for. Ex: custom_uptime_ratios=7-30-45 to get the uptime ratios for those periods)
custom_down_durations	optional (returns the "custom down durations" for given periods in "custom_uptime_ratios")
custom_uptime_ranges	optional (defines the ranges to calculate the uptime ratio(s) for. Ex: custom_uptime_ranges=1465440758_1466304758 to get the uptime ratios for those periods. It is possible to send multiple ranges like 1465440758_1466304758-1434682358_1434855158)
all_time_uptime_ratio	optional (returns the "all time uptime ratio". It will slow down the response a bit and, if not really necessary, suggest not using it. Default is 0)
all_time_uptime_durations	optional (returns the "all time durations of up-down-paused events". It will slow down the response a bit and, if not really necessary, suggest not using it. Default is 0)
logs	optional (defines if the logs of each monitor will be returned. Should be set to 1 for getting the logs. Default is 0)
logs_start_date	optional (works only for the Pro Plan as 24 hour+ logs are kept only in the Pro Plan, formatted as Unix time and must be used with logs_end_date)
logs_end_date	optional (works only for the Pro Plan as 24 hour+ logs are kept only in the Pro Plan, formatted as Unix time and must be used with logs_start_date)
log_types	optional (the types of logs to be returned with a usage like: log_types=1-2-98). If empty, all log types are returned.

response_times_average	optional (by default, response time value of each check is returned. The API can return average values in given minutes. Default is 0. For ex: the UptimeRobot dashboard displays the data averaged/grouped in 30 minutes)
response_times_start_date	optional (formatted as Unix time and must be used with response_times_end_date) (response_times_end_date - response_times_start_date can't be more than 7 days)
response_times_end_date	optional (formatted as Unix time and must be used with response_times_start_date) (response_times_end_date - response_times_start_date can't be more than 7 days)
alert_contacts	optional (defines if the alert contacts set for the monitor to be returned. Default is 0.)
